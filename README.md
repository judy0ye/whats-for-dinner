### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The learning goals include practicing using HTML, CSS, and JS to build an application that matches the provided comp and gain experience in listening to/responding to user events.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
Wins:
- I figured out that I couldn't target a class that was created by the DOM outside of that function.

- I figured out that to target a grandparent element, I have to use the parentElement twice.

Challenges:
- It took me hours to figure out I couldn't target/use querySelector on an element created by the DOM outside of the function that injected the HTML. I had to phone a friend for help. 

- I would've put the "Add to Favorites" and "View Favorites" in the box created by the DOM to make the page more esthetic also, but I ran out of time before figuring out how to target it. I will apply this knowledge on the next project.
